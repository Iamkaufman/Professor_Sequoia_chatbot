Project Title: Professor Sequoia Pokemon VGC Teambuilder
Designer: Alex Kaufman

Professor Sequoia is a Pokemon VGC chatbot designed to provide reliable teambuilding advice.
The  name was chosen to suggest a Pokemon Professor to convey Pokemon expertise.
Other AI tools, even those designed for Pokemon, can struggle in making reliable suggestions
sometimes suggesting banned Pokemon.
Professor Sequoia is designed to adress those problems and help especially new players learn to
construct more powerful teams by helping to make team choices based on metagame data.
